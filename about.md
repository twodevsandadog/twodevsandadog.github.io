![Pride Parade with my Partner](/assets/pride.jpg){:width="400px"}

My name is Britney and I am a software developer and hobby enthusiast. I say hobby entusiast because I enjoy diving into many different types of things and can never narrow it down to just a few.

I am originally from Ohio, then I moved Seattle, Washington, now I live in Amsterdam. I moved here for a job originally, now I am a freelance developer for a few companies or contract full time. My favorite technologies are NodeJS, Serverless Framework, AWS, Javascript, Java, Spring, VueJS and Alexa.

I will be using this blog to dive into interesting projects that I'm working on or talk about processes I'm passionate about in the software space.

If you know of a project I may be interested in let me know! You can view [my resume here][1].
