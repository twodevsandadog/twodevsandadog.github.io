![Pride Parade with my Partner](/assets/pride.jpg){:width="400px"}

My name is Britney and I am a software developer and hobby enthusiast.  I say hobby entusiast because I enjoy diving into many different types of things and can never narrow it down to just a few.

I am originally from Ohio, then I moved Seattle, Washington, now I live in Amsterdam.  I moved here for a job.  Over the last year I've done a lot of thinking, and while I am not sure of many things, I am now sure that I don't want to work my life away on someone else's terms.

Many people are content with full time jobs, and I used to be, but now I think life is just too short to spend 30%+ of my life putting time and energy into a company that I don't care too much about, or worse, one that I dislike.

This blog is about my journey to figure out what life can look like working part time and doing work that I want to be doing.

If you know of a project I may be interested in let me know!  My main drive right now is pretty simple - I want my work to benefit the world and the people in it, and I want the company I am working for to do the same.  You can view [my resume here][1].
