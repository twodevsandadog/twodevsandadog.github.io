<h3>Welcome to Two Devs and a Dog!</h3>

My name is Britney and I am the owner of this (very) small software consultancy company.

I currently live and work in Utrecht, Netherlands and I specialize in bootstrapping web applications. I worked at
Amazon/AWS for 4 years and I have experience in Java, Javascript, NodeJS, Spring, Serverless Framework, AWS, cloud services and full stack architecture. I have an eye for making an application simply, to allow you to support it easily from a cost and time perspective.

<a href="mailto:britney.devs@gmail.com">Send me an email!</a>

I can work with you to turn your use cases and ideas into a proof of concept proposal that will work perfectly for you, then I can work with my resources to get it done in a timeline you are comfortable with.

I do not (yet) have public projects to show in this blog but if you send me an email I can show you what I'm working on.
