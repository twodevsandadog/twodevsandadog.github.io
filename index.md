<h3>Welcome to Two Devs and a Dog!</h3>

My name is Britney and I am the owner of this (very) small software consultancy company.

I currently live and work in Amsterdam and I specialize in bootstrapping web applications.  I worked at 
Amazon Web Services for 4 years and I have experience in AWS, cloud services and full stack architecture.  I have an eye for making an application the simplest way possible with the least components, to allow you to support it easy from a cost and time perspective.  My main languages for building stacks right now are Javascript, Java and Python but I use other technologies like bash when they are more appropriate.

I can work with you to turn your use cases and ideas into a proof of concept proposal that will work perfectly for you, then I can work with my resources to get it done in a timeline you are comfortable with.

I do not (yet) have public projects to show you but if you send me an email I can give you an idea of what I have been working on lately at <a href="mailto:britney.devs@gmail.com">britney.devs@gmail.com</a>
