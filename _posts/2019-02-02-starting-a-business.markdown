### How it all started

I quit my software development job last year in October.  Since then I have navigated the Dutch system of creating a business (here called a B.V.), applying for a new visa and marketing myself to find freelance software development work.  When I first considered this path it looked completely daunting.

To give you some background as to why I chose to do this, I had been working at a big software development company for 4 years.  For a large portion of that I did enjoy it and I learned a lot.  Over the last year though I had become more aware of unfair wage distributions and the politics I had to play in the workplace became more apparent.  I noticed that I had gotten to a place where I wasn't actually delivering any software.  Most of my time was spent talking about things and guiding, which is fine, except that talk never contributed to something happening.

I wanted to get back to delivering software again.  My options were to find a new full time job or start this freelancing route.  There were a lot of things to consider on these two routes.

For one, pay in the Netherlands for a full time software engineer is not what it is in the US.  It wasn't all about money, but I do want to buy an apartment eventually or move back to the states where I will need more savings.  Considering that I did not want to go back to another large bureaucratic company, the options left for this was smaller companies and startups.  Those offer even lower salaries than the large established companies.

I also like the idea of freelance in that I can work on a project for a few months and then simply change to a new one.  The idea of that seems refreshing after the grind of trying to convince a company to upgrade and maintain legacy software over a long period of time.  Doing the features a client needs and then moving on was an appealing one.

To sum it up, I didn't want to take a 50% pay cut and I didn't want to work for another large company.  That leaves one option: starting my own company and freelancing.

### Logistics

The short checklist I had: create the company, apply for a new visa, find work.  Three things, all of which proved more difficult than I thought.  In the US freelancing is as easy as doing work and collecting 1099 (contractor) forms, in the Netherlands I needed to create a B.V. (similar to an LLC) in order to file VAT taxes and file for my new visa.  Included in that is using a lawyer and notary to define and incorporate the company and finding and paying an accountant to keep books and file my corporate taxes and VAT taxes.  None of these things are cheap in Amsterdam.

Luckily the visa portion of this was the easiest.  There is something called the [Dutch American Friendship Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAFT) which makes it relatively easy for American freelancers and entreprenuers to get a 2 year visa.  I can verify this later since mine is still waiting to be approved.

Luckily after all this I still qualify for something called the 30% ruling, which means that 30% of my income is not taxed.  This is in place to help The Netherlands compete for more highly skilled migrants from countries with lower income tax (like the US).  It's temporary though, it only lasts a few years.

### Finding Work

This!  I want to say this was the most intimidating prospect of this decision, but I am not even sure.  All of these things were very intimidating from the context of doing them in another country where I cannot read or speak Dutch (yet!).  I asked the software freelancers I knew (not many) where they found work and I got equally intimidating answers mostly equivalent to "Oh through a friend of a friend, happenstance connections".  What am I supposed to do with that?!  Many of them said work and projects found them after they talked to some people.  It seemed very mystical.

First I will say that I am still far from an expert at finding freelance software development work.  But I will say I have worked on two projects so far, and have had quite a few interviews and leads.  From the work I have found, in hindsight, I would probably give the same answer as those freelancers I asked.  I found them through friends of friends and happenstance introductions.  I've also applied for countless "remote" contractor positions on the internet which has brought me 0 leads.

I admit, I have been picky though.  I have passed on many interviews or leads that were at large companies that fely like they would be soul draining.  Anything that seemed like more bureaucracy than software development I dropped, or I asked for a dollar amount that would make the work okay for me.  That amount isn't usually well received.

I don't regret being picky.  My choices in what leads to follow has led me mostly to work with start ups and small companies which I think is where I fit right now.  I don't know if I'm ready to join a start up, but I am enjoying helping to bootstrap start ups.  I'm a little behind on bills but that's okay for now.

### Recommendations

I am so glad I have stuck to my principles during this process.  A few times I considered taking a full time "contractor" position at a larger company but I ultimately did not.  I think it might be due to being fed up at my previous job, but I am glad I have resisted larger companies going forward.  One of the start ups I have worked with has been so rewarding and I feel a higher sense of accomplishment knowing that I support what they're trying to do and I really do hope they succeed.  I hope to have many more experiences like that in my freelance journey.

If you are trying to go down the same path I would have the same advice for you.  Remember why you started freelancing in the first place and what you were looking for.  Keep that in your mind when you are searching for work.  It will help guarentee you don't end up in a similar position to where you were before, when you were maybe less happy with your working life.

I would love to hear your suggestions!  I am still very new to this world.  Also, obviously, if your start up needs help boostrapping their web service in AWS don't hesitate to contact me as well ;)
