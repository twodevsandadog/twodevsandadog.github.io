All or most software projects benefit from some forethought and planning. Going directly to writing code can cost you valuable time and churn if you don't know the exact goals you're working towards.

Even just documenting significant use cases can be a great start. It gives you a way to divide up what you're working on and document progress as you are able to finish things.

Better than that would be a document with more details about exactly how you intend to achieve those use cases - what technologies are you going to use? What does the API look like? This will allow you to more closely track that you are making progress on what you need to with the benefit of making it easier to work with others.

Below I am going to put an example of a design document with all of the components that I think are beneficial for communicating, reviewing and making clear progress on a software project.
