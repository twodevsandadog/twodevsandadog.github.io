# Unmap Me

## Context

A major service or use case of the internet is to enable users to find things in the physical world that they are looking for. The biggest applications used for this right now are Google, Google Maps, Apple Maps, I will refer to these as mapped-based applications. These work great for finding a general assortment of establishments and locations and every location includes types of information that applies to all locations (description, phone number, website, open hours). What these applications do not do well is provide information specific to the different types of locations. For example, if the location is a clothing store, what is the price point? Do they provide clothes for men, women, children? Plus sizes?

As a conseqence these platforms are great for seeing where a location is and how 'good' a random demographic consider the location (0-5 star reviews). What they are not good at is providing useful information specific to the type of location that it is.

There are some applications for more niche location finding - HappyCow.net being a good example. HappyCow.net provides locations and details only for restaurants with vegan and vegetarian options. There are also small examples such as the 'Store Locator' features on company websites (https://www.lowes.com/store/).

## Problem Summary

There is an opportunity here, in between the Google Maps use case and the niche location finders. Google Maps has great UX, but not great niche location information. Other mapped based applications have great niche location information, but not great user experience and they are complicated to develop.
