With my first post I want to give some introduction as to what I will be putting here.  From that you can decide how interested you are in reading.

My first inspiration for starting this was the absence of information on the internet around starting a business in the Netherlands.  When I decided to finally quit my job I had a stressful few weeks talking to anyone who would give me a moment about how I should be starting a company and applying for a new visa.  There are many facets to it and it can get expensive if you are not careful.  I would like to provide more information to empower others to do the same.  I want to put the idea out there that there is not just one option for work.

I was also inspired by [medium.com](https://medium.com) and the dialog it perpetuates.  I had lost hope that intelligent dialog and content still existed on the internet until I found medium.  I would like to help contribute to that and keep it going.  So this blog will also include my perspectives on work life balance, gender inequality in software and general thoughts about how we could be doing things better in the corporate world.  I may copy my posts to medium if I think they fit there.

And ultimately if we could start more of a dialog about how our world works and how we may be able to improve it we can improve our lives and world for the better, faster.  Probably a lofty goal for a humble blog, but I have to start somewhere, right?

Oh yea, and I am an unemployed software developer at the moment, so I will be putting some of my developer projects on this page.  We'll see what I can do with all this time I have now!
